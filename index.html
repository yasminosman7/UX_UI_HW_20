    <h2>Water Smart Foundation Redesign.</h2>
    <h3>A comprehensive redesign of a non profit website.</h3>

        <h5>Problem</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        <p>The Water Smart Foundation (WSF) website while having a strong colour scheme and noble cause, was lacking intuitive information architecture and a user centred focus throughout the website. The problem the organisation was aiming to solve was unclear and the imagery used did not support the understanding of the organisation’s goals and activities.</p>

        <div class="col">
          <h5>Solution</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <p>My team and I embarked on a redesign of this website with the user end goal in mind, which was donating. We transformed the information architecture and navigation with the new goal of educating users on the cause, which would inform them enough to be able to make a donation. Our user testing on the original website showed that users would be more open to donate if they had more information on the cause and exactly how the organisation completes it’s goal of decreasing microplastics in the ocean.</p>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <p>We conducted 4 user interviews and sent out a survey to understand what users wanted from the WSF website. We constructed our questions around people’s charitable habits; their philosophy around the environment and what actions they take to help it; and finally what thoughts and pain points they had around the WSF website. We wanted to know what the determining factors were when users donated and how we could apply that to the WSF website. We also wanted to know the interviewee's thoughts around existing non profit websites to further inform our future design decisions.</p>
